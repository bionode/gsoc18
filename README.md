## Summary

This is my final report for Google Summer of code(GSOC) which contains my weekely report and the things which I've learned 
through out my journey. I learned various new things throughout my gsoc journey. All these things are added in my [Journal](#notebook-week-reports).
Apart from this I've encountered various challenges so I've tried to explain all these things and learning from these 
challenges so I've made a [learning-guide](https://github.com/bionode/gsoc18/blob/master/learning.md) which is basically
targeting the people who want to work from basics and want to know from where to start from the codebase.

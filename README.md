## Summary

This is my final report for Google Summer of code(GSOC) which contains my weekely report and the things which I've learned 
through out my journey. I learned various new things throughout my gsoc journey. All these things are added in my [Journal](#notebook-week-reports).
Apart from this I've encountered various challenges so I've tried to explain all these things and learning from these 
challenges so I've made a [learning-guide](https://github.com/bionode/gsoc18/blob/master/learning.md) which is basically
targeting the people who want to work from basics and want to know from where to start from the codebase.

## Learning

I made this guide because I've faced various challenges while comfortable with this project so if any person
wants to work or contribute to this so basically a confusion always comes into mind how to start and understanding a
big codebase is not easy at-least not for me. So, I've tried to explain all the things which is essential for this 
project and from where anyone can start. So, basically it can be a developer guide to make comfortable the new developers
. I am still updating the guide like when I found a new challenging thing so I try to explain the problem and desired
solution in my guide.

## Merged pull requests

* [PR #94](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/pull/94) :- Workflow Status.

This PR conatains the work of 3 other PR so we have merged all the work into one PR.
* [PR #93](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/pull/93)
* [PR #92](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/pull/92)
* [PR #91](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/pull/91)


* [Issue95](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/issues/95) Currently working on this issue basically I've completed
almost 70% of it so I will try to complete it before the gsoc ends.



## What was not done and why

Unforunately due to my college exams I was not able to start on time so basically I'm not able to acheive some of the goals.
I will not able to do in my gsoc time but I will try to do all these things after my gsoc because GSOC made me habbit to 
contribution to Open source so I will love to work on these after gsoc.

[Issue95](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/issues/95) I'm currently working but if I'm not able to acheive this 
so I will continue to this work after my GSOC.

## Summary

During this week basically I've done small tasks like getting familiar with the [bionode-watermill](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill)
by doing it's [examples](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/blob/master/examples). In this learning about task and
orchestrators (join, junction and fork).I'm also able to setup [bionode-watermill](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill) with the help of docker using this [docker-tutorial](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill-tutorial/tree/master/docker-watermill-tutorial) but this was only used for two-mapper example. I'm also able to setup [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) with the help of docs.


## Getting familiar with bionode-watermill

For getting familiar with [bionode-watermill](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill). I started working on existing examples which is their in project itself for better understanding. I learn how to make task and use of orchestrators (join, junction and fork). I also made a small pipeline which basically takes fasta file as input and concat all these files and then it will Capitalize all the output file which is came from Concat task. This task is combination of first and second examples present in existing example [MyPipeline](https://github.com/evoxtorm/watermill_examples/blob/master/Newtry.js).

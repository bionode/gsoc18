## Summary

During this week basically I've done small tasks like getting familiar with the [bionode-watermill](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill)
by doing it's [examples](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/blob/master/examples). In this learning about task and
orchestrators (join, junction and fork).I'm also able to setup [bionode-watermill](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill) with the help of docker using this [docker-tutorial](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill-tutorial/tree/master/docker-watermill-tutorial) but this was only used for two-mapper example. I'm also able to setup [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) with the help of docs.

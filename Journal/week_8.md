# Week 8 (1 July to 7 July)


- [Summary](#summary)



## Summary

This week was pretty busy due to some personal reasons I was not able to give time but this we have discussed [Issue-95](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/issues/95)
basically which is for how to handle external inputs like taking an `inputs.json` file then resolving it. One thing more we 
have discussed like basically we can check that is there any external input then if it is available then resolved that task
or if it is not avialable then proceed to the lifecycle of the `watermill`.

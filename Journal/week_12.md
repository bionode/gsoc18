## Summary

This week is majorly dedicated to the documentation of the journal which was not completed so I started working
on it the journal and other small things which need to be documented. The overall all the work will be documented so 
that other developer get to know about the difficulity about the project and can learn the mistakes which I've made 
and which have taken lot of time. So basically it can help new developers to get started.

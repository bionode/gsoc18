## Summary

This week I majorly focused on understanding the codebase basically `lifecycle.js` and `shell.js` apart from this I've
worked on `Pull request` [#93](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/pull/93) in which I was working on error. In which
we have to provide the `absolute path` to the run a file using `child-process` so , if we provide `relative path` it gives the 
error `Cannot find the module`. For rectifying this error I've worked on understanding the `[shell.js](https://github.com/evoxtorm/bionode-watermill/blob/master/lib/utils/shell.js)` and `[lifecycle.js](https://github.com/evoxtorm/bionode-watermill/blob/master/lib/sagas/lifecycle.js)` .

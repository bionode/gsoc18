## Summary

This week is dedicated to working on `input staging` which is inspired from [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/), this will help 
in creating a working directory for inputs so that it can be used easily. This week we also discussed about refactoring the 
code like removing that part of code which hard to understand. So, basically all these things are in development phase if 
it will be feasible then it will changed. This week I also worked on `learning.md` which is basically a guide which helps to 
give the direction to the new devlopers who want to learn and contribue to `bionode-watermill`.


## Progress

This week is majorly dedicated to **input staging** which is inspired from [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/), which helps in
creating a working directory for inputs. For more information you can refer [here](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/15-staging/).

Key points for Staging Input Files are :-

* Input files are normally kept in a read-only directory
* Use `InitialWorkDirRequirement` to stage input files in the working directory

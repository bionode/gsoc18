## Summary

This week is dedicated to working on `input staging` which is inspired from [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/), this will help 
in creating a working directory for inputs so that it can be used easily. This week we also discussed about refactoring the 
code like removing that part of code which hard to understand.

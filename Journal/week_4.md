# Week 4 (30 May to 6 June)

- [Summary](#summary)
- [Working with CWL](#working-with-cwl)



## Summary

This week starting days is dedicated to the [common workflow language](https://www.commonwl.org/) which allows for easier desi
gn and manipulation of tools in a workflow.CWL is well suited for describing large-scale workflows in cluster, cloud and high 
performance computing environments where tasks are scheduled in parallel across many nodes.


## Working with CWL

I started working with CWL with the help of [docs](http://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/) and working on the example 
which is there in the docs guide and some from [CWl-example-repo](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows).
Then I started working on simple example like `fastq-dump` tool which is the intial step of the [two-mappers-example](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/blob/46499966a41c5977941ba4b617298aa64192b2c3/examples/pipelines/two-mappers/pipeline.js#L58).

# Week 5 (7 June to 14 June)

 ## Summary
 
 This week is dedicated to rectifying the `unhandled rejection` and `uncaught -error`. So basically I've used redux to test
 the failure of `child-process` which is due to `unhanddled rejection` and `uncaught-error`. In this test I've made a testpipeline which does a simple `task` and using `child-process` to perform other other tasks.
 
 
 ## Progress
 
 Since this week is started by learning the fundamental concepts of `redux` which I learned from the [docs](https://redux.js.org/basics).
 While doing some of the task and example pipeline we find out that there is `unhandled-rejection` and `child-process` exits
 and rest of the task is also existed so we have taken the example of `CWL` for workflow failure and success. WHich is
 explained [here](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/Workflow.html#Workflow).

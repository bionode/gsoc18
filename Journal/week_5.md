# Week 5 (7 June to 14 June)


- [Summary](#summary)



 ## Summary
 
 This week is dedicated to rectifying the `unhandled rejection` and `uncaught -error`. So basically I've used redux to test
 the failure of `child-process` which is due to `unhanddled rejection` and `uncaught-error`. In this test I've made a testpipeline which does a simple `task` and using `child-process` to perform other other tasks.
